Service 14.	Solar Energy Service 
Description: Create a service that returns the annual average sunshine index of a given position (latitude, longitude). This service can be used for deciding if installing solar energy device is effective at the location.
Operation: decimal SolarIntensity(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)
Input: latitude and longitude
Output: a number reflecting the annual average solar intensity at the location.
You must discover what is available and how the discovered service can be used.

Service 15.	Wind Energy Service 
Description: Create a service that returns the annual average wind index of a given position (latitude, longitude). This service can be used for deciding if installing windmill device is effective at the location.
Operation: decimal WindIntensity(decimal latitude, decimal longitude)
Input: latitude and longitude
Output: a number reflecting the annual average wind intensity at the location.
You must discover what is available and how the discovered service can be used.

Hint: you may find solar and wind data from sources like:
